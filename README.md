# PYTHON PASSWORD STRENGTH EVALUATOR:

I have created a python based strength evaluator. With this application you are able to  strengthen you existing passwords as well as create new passwords from scratch with our tips that our application will grade help improve.

## HOW TO USE:

To use it simply enter your password into the password box and hit check password button, the application will give your password a rating out of 5 stars and give suggestions on how to improve it as well. You can hit the hide password button to cover your password (for privacy reasons) and the copy button to copy your password to the clipboard and paste it into the password space of any of your accounts. If you are feeling lost you can open the tips menu to find out where to start with the creation of your new password!
